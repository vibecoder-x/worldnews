2. Look for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests

### If APIs not working:
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API keys in js/config.js
- HTTPS is required for geolocation (Vercel provides this automatically)

### If geolocation not working:
- Must use HTTPS (Vercel provides this ✅)
